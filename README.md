# VisClaimer - from visual evidence to clear claims
VisClaimer is an interactive interface built on the claim-evidence framework. It demonstrates how scientific charts and their captions encode multiple possible messages and how different reasoning strategies shape the claims that readers can draw.

## Project Goals
VisClaimer helps users search and reason with scientific visualizations:
- **Multiple sources, one topic** â€“ Enter a topic and see a list of chart + caption pairs whose data support claims similar to your query.
- **One chart, many claims** â€“ Explore a single chart + caption pair and examine how multiple, distinct claims can emerge from the same evidence.
- **Reasoning strategies revealed** â€“ Discover how claims differ because different reasoning strategies (e.g., contrastive reasoning, causal inference, corroboration, triangulation) were used to link evidence to conclusions.

This UI illustrates the core idea: that a chart and caption together form a claim-evidence unit which, when reframed, can support multiple scientifically valid messages
